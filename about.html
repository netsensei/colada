<h1>The manifest</h1>

<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I'm a 30-something web developer hailing from Bruges, Belgium. I love to read
&amp; watch movies. I like exploring with my trusty Nikon. I like tinkering with
computers and code. Climbing is my physical outlet. I'm always on the discovery
of new, thrilling music and I enjoy the taste of a well crafted plate of
food.</p>

<p>I got my first taste of the Web back in 1997 when the on line world was
basically primordial soup and I hacked my first HTML website on my dads' PC over
summer break.</p>

<p>I really got involved with all things IT during my academic years at the
university. In 2003, I registered <a href="http://www.netsensei.b">netsensei.be
</a> and started blogging. First with <a href="http://movabletype.org/">Movable
Type</a>, but soon switched to <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. The
online revolution was just about to explode.</p>

<p>After graduating and obtaining masters in History and Applied Informatics, I
 spent several years contributing to a research project involving digitization
and dissemination of digital content at the City Archives of Antwerp. In the
evening hours, I started discovering the wonderful world of PHP, MySQL, Linux,
Apache and much, much more.</p>

<p>In 2008, I decided to make a bold careermove and follow my passion: the Web.
I started out as a developer for Statik and did the odd freelance stint. Between
2009 and 2012, I worked as a full time <a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>
developer and trainer for Wunderkraut.</p>

<p>Today I craft projects as a Drupal developer for XIO Belgium.</p>

<h2>About this website</h2>

<p>Since 2009, this website has existed in various forms. I call it my own
  little digital factory. It's a playground, a publishing periodical, my own
personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs">Bell Labs</a> and so
much more.</p>
