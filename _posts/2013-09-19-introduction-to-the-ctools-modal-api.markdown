So, I finally did a first screencast with my new gear. Over the past few months,
I had to implement a so called 'modal' pop-up on occasion. These popups are used
for instant actions: login forms, selecting stuff, etc. without reloading the
entire page. The <a href="http://drupal.org/project/ctools">Chaos Tools</a>
suite contains a nice Modal API subset. Instead of using all kinds of 3rd party
Javascript/CSS libraries, it's more practical to rely on CTools to get a popup.
In fact, it's the same API used to create those fancy popup's you see when using
 Panels or the Panels In-Place Editor.

Without further ado:

While I've done the odd screencast in the past, this is the first attempt in a
long time with proper equipment. Obviously, I'll need to practice to tone down
the rough edges. But overall, I'm pretty pleased with this result.
