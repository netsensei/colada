Say hello to the new colada.be. This site has gotten a complete overhaul over the
last couple of weeks. It's been designed and rebuild from scratch. It's one
project I wanted to do over the fall season. I didn't only got a shiny new site,
I also got to explore and learn quite a lot in the process.

## Choosing Jekyll over a fully fledged CMS

I've decided to move away from Drupal and choose Jekyll as the motor for this
site. Since I'm a Drupal developer by trade, such change is a Big Thing. However
there are well-founded arguments to make such a move:

* This site is just a simple blog. Drupal is a complete content management
framework. Even out of the box, it does a lot more then I need. Adding
unneccessary complexity comes at a cost when it comes to security & performance.
Any database-driven CMS requires regular attention and upkeep.

* I wanted to learn new stuff. I've been completely missing the boat at the
frontend of web development. SASS, mobile, frameworks,... I've been encapsulated
in this bubble called Drupal. This prompted me to explicitely dip my toes in new
waters. Not having to care about the underlying CMS was important if I
wanted to keep my focus on just writing frontend matter.

* <em>If you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail</em>. Drupal is
great, and it  allows you to build blogs, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's
the best tool. It's <em>always</em> worth exploring what's out there.

Just serving plain HTML & CSS makes sense when you're keeping things simple.
Static site generators are just what you need: they automate just the most
painstaking tasks when maintaining a collection of HTML documents.

Static site generators aren't a new concept, but the Jekyll project definitely
has made them increasingly more popular in recent times. It's a logical choice
since there's plenty documentation out there, and it's community is thriving.

## New paintjob

I've choosen to refit the entire look & feel of the site. Here's why.

I'm not a designer. Not in sense that I can come up with awesome looking
Photoshop designs with a few flicks of my mouse. However, I know what I like and
I've read enough about typography, grid layouts and color to know what works and
what doesn't. I still wanted to give the creative spark a chance, and so I
challenged myself.

The previous version relied on Drupal's default Bartik theme. I didn't bother
building a new Drupal theme back then. The downside was that the site looked
very unpersonal and very generic. I didn't like it and it didn't motivate me
to blog regularly.

## The process

I've taken the opportunity to devise an entirely new personal frontend
development process. It was the perfect moment to pick up new things and look
what did and didn't work.
