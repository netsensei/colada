Say hello to the new colada.be. This site has gotten a complete overhaul over the
last couple of weeks. It's been designed and rebuild from scratch. The only thing
which hasn't changed completely is the content. It's one project I wanted to do
over the fall season. I didn't only got a shiny new site, I also got to explore and
learn quite a lot in the process.

## Moving to Jekyll

I've decided to move away from Drupal and choose Jekyll as the motor for this site.
It's a big leap. Although I'm a Drupal developer by trade, there are several well
founded arguments to make such a move:

* This site is just a simple blog. Drupal is a complete content management framework.
Even out of the box, it does a lot more then I need. Adding unneccessary complexity comes
at a cost when it comes to security & performance. Any database-driven CMS requires
regular upkeep. Even WordPress.

* Just serving plain HTML & CSS makes sense when you're keeping things simple. Static
site generators are just what you need: they automate just those most painstaking tasks
when maintaining a collection of HTML documents.

* I wanted to learn new stuff. I've been completely missing the boat at the frontend
of web development. Compass, mobile,... I've been encapsulated in this bubble which
is Drupal. That's why I explicitely wanted to dip my toes in completely new water. Not
having to care about the underlying CMS is an important factor in this learning process.

Static site generators aren't a new concept, but the Jekyll project definitely has
made them increasingly more popular in recent times. It's a logical choice since there's
plenty documentation out there, and it's community is thriving.

If you have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. Any solution is just that: a
solution for a given set of problems. It's <em>always</em> worth exploring what's out
there.

## A new paintjob

The previous incarnation featured Drupal's stock Bartik theme. I didn't want the hassle
of desiging and writing the thing. The end-result was bland and unappealing. It didn't have
any personality.

I'm not a designer. Not in sense that I can come up with awesome looking Photoshop designs
with a few flicks of my mouse. However, I know what I like and I've read enough about
typography, grid layouts and color to know what works and what doesn't. I still wanted to
give the creative spark a chance, and so I challenged myself. Hope you like the end result.

## Engineering

Did I learn new things? Well, more then you know it! These are few things I learned:

* Jekyll: it's build with Ruby, so I took some babysteps learning Ruby. I had to learn
how to tame Jekyll and how to control what kind of HTML it spits out.

* SASS: I was sceptical at first , but no more: it's an eye-opener to see how well
structured my CSS is, and how easy it is to do away with long stylesheets.

* Grunt: Late in the project @frankbaele showed me the power of Grunt. The 24ways article
was a early Christmas gift. I've gone completely Grunt over a weekend, never to turn back.

* Mobile: I finally went on to design for mobile devices leveraging mediaqueries, breakpoints
and much more.

There's of course, a lot more. Expect this project to spawn several more in-depth
articles.
