So, last week, I gave my eponimously title talk <a href="http://leuven2013.drupalcamp.be/session/community-how-do-i-get-involved">The Community: How do I get
involved?</a> at <a href="http://www.drupalcamp.be">DrupalCampBE Leuven</a>.
Meanwhile, <a href="http://svendecabooter.be/">Sven</a> got the recording of the
session up on YouTube and I uploaded the slides themselves to Slideshare.

I ended up having way more slides then time to cover them all. So, the recording
ends probably half way. Without further ado:

Find <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/netsensei/drupalcampbe-2013-the-drupal-community-how-to-contribute?ref=http://localhost:4000/">the slides on SlideShare</a>.
