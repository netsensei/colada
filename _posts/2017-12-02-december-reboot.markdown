So, December has kicked off. It's a nice opportunity to do a reboot as we 
approach the end of the year. I'm active in the field of GLAM institutions. 
Galleries, libraries, archives and Museums. As a digital specialist, I'm 
involved in the ongoing digitisation or automatisation of processes within 
these organisations. Coming from the private sector, I apply my experience 
of realising digital projects of various scale and size for a wide variety of 
clients, on a daily basis on an operational level. Doing a blog series about 
the experience of these past few years has been on a my wish list for a while 
now.

When we're talking about digital within the GLAM domain, the discussion tends 
to focus on so-called digital collections and the challenges associated with 
these collections. Questions about preservation and dissemination of digital 
born or digitized materials come in the limelight. Finding clear cut answers 
isn't straightforward and often raises more questions. The challenges 
I have encountered so far, should be considered [wicked problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem). This implies that strategies and protocols have to evolve as 
GLAM institutions keep redefining their role within an ever changing societal 
context.

Sharing knowledge, experiences and tools are absolutely crucial if we want to 
be able to preserve and open up (digital) collections for generations to come.

What am I going to blog about? Over the past few years, I've been mainly 
involved in designing and building digital architectures for sharing and 
reusing metadata related to cultural heritage objects. Many of my blog posts 
will reflect on the technical tools and the practices we use on a daily basis 
to solve operational challenges. I don't want to limit myself to the purely 
technical side, though. I'll also explore the thinking processes and the 
considerations that go in choosing these strategies and tools and the many 
pitfalls which lurk below the surface.

My audience for this series is anyone who involved with digital activities 
within their GLAM organisation and faces questions about managing digital 
collections. My aim is to point readers in a helpful direction, and to 
provide inspiration as they work on realising their own digital strategies.

I will assume you have some technical experience as delving into basic 
programming/coding principles is not within the scope of this series. Though, I 
will add enough references to basic background information.

Now, let's get started.
