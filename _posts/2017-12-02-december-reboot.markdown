So, December has kicked off. It's a nice opportunity to do a reboot as we 
approach the end of the year. I'm active in the field of [GLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAM_(industry_sector)) 
institutions. Galleries, libraries, archives and Museums. As a digital 
specialist, I'm involved in the ongoing digitisation or automatisation of 
processes within these organisations. Coming from the private sector, I apply 
my experience of realising digital projects of various scale and size for a 
wide variety of clients, on a daily basis on an operational level. Doing a 
blog series about the experience of these past few years has been on a my wish 
list for a while now.

When we're talking about digital within the GLAM domain, the discussion tends 
to focus on so-called digital collections and the challenges associated with 
these collections. Questions about preservation and dissemination of digital 
born or digitized materials come in the limelight. Finding clear cut answers 
isn't straightforward and often raises more questions. Where to start? How do 
we define success factors? What are suitable KPI's? How can we account for the 
investments of significant budgets in digital projects which have limited 
lifetime before they become obsolete?

So far, I acknowledge many of the challenges I have faced to be 
[wicked problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem). Often there 
are no 'absolute' answer and is a self-defined framework of values and 
principles the primary foundation in validating and choosing a suitable 
strategy when going forward. This also implies that strategies and protocols 
have to evolve as GLAM institutions keep redefining their role within an ever 
changing societal context.

Sharing knowledge, experiences and tools are absolutely crucial if we want to 
be able to preserve and open up (digital) collections for generations to come.

What am I going to blog about? Over the past few years, I've been mainly 
involved in designing and building digital architectures for sharing and 
reusing metadata related to cultural heritage objects. Many of my blog posts 
will reflect on the technical tools and the practices we use on a daily basis 
to solve operational challenges. I don't want to limit myself to the purely 
technical side, though. I'll also explore the thinking processes and the 
considerations that go in choosing these strategies and tools and the many 
pitfalls which lurk below the surface.

My audience for this series is anyone who involved with digital activities 
within their GLAM organisation and faces questions about managing digital 
collections. My aim is to point readers in a helpful direction, and to 
provide inspiration as they work on realising their own digital strategies.

I will assume you have some technical experience as delving into basic 
programming/coding principles is not within the scope of this series. Though, I 
will add enough references to basic background information.

Now, let's get started.
