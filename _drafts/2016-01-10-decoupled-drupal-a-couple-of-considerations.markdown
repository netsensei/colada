Over the past few months, Dries has posted a series of blogposts about decoupled Drupal: The future of decoupled Drupal, Should we decouple Drupal with a client-side framework and Selecting a client-side framework for Drupal. The explore the impact of decoupling front-end from the back-end architecture alltogether via Javascript and web API's. Here are a few of my own thoughts on the subject.

Is a decoupled CMS a good thing?

In an era with a growing demand for multichannel publishing, decoupling the frontend from the backend is logical evolution. Daniel Jacobsons' seminal article about [COPE](http://www.programmableweb.com/news/cope-create-once-publish-everywhere/2009/10/13) has sparked new ways of thinking about how we can leverage content.

* Content management.
* Presentation of content on the web.

Today, the latter function has changed vastly:

* Context bound - or tailored - presentation.
